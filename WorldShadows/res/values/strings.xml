This application shows the shadow generated by the sun on a given object, for a particular day and time.	\n
You can move the slider to change the time from the selected day (today as default) and see the projected shadow.
\n
	\n
If the compass is not working correctly or it is very unstable, select the current time and day (option menu "now"), press the screen (once or twice) to stop the sensor rotations, and move the phone until the shadow you see in reality has the same direction as the shadow on the screen. Now move the slider to see the shadow’s evolution during the day.\n
	\n
An internet connection is only necessary to obtain the location information, and not for the shadow calculations.	\n
<!-- To get a correct shadow it is not necessary a very precise longitude and latitude values, so the utilization a low accuracy method.
